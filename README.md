Swipeaway is a brain game that tests the players' level of attention, reflexes, and multitasking ability.
It involves levels with multiple lanes with a sprite in each lane. Obstacles are generated to the right of 
screen and move across to the left. The player must swipe the obstacles from lane to lane to avoid the sprites.

Known issues/bugs

  Game lags, different speeds on different devices leading to an unfair advantage for people with slow phones

  On mobile browsers, the address bar interferes with the game screen

  If the game page is accessed in portrait mode, then switched to landscape mode, the sprites remain squished to one side

  Sprites disappear before they reach the left side of the screen sometimes

  If multiple obstacles collide with different sprites at the same time, the correct number of lives is not always taken away in endless mode
